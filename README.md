## 🔍 Features

- **Binary Image Classification**: Accurately classify images of cats vs. dogs.
- **Training Visualization**: View how the model learns over time.
- **Data Augmentation**: Improve model performance with various image transformations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use without technical expertise.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 📊 Understanding the Model

The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are great for processing visual data. This method allows the application to learn and classify images effectively. By using TensorFlow and Keras, the classifier can handle many images with high accuracy.

## 📝 Tips for Better Classification

- **Use Clear Images**: Upload images that are not blurry and are focused on either a cat or a dog.
- **Avoid Complicated Backgrounds**: Images with busy backgrounds may confuse the model.
- **Test Various Samples**: Try different images to see how well the application performs.
